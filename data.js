Someone told me about the new Circular Engineering programme, an engineering degree taught through the lens of sustainability. It covers a broad range of subjects across both sustainability and technical skills, and that broad foundation naturally leads you to a master's that suits you. For me, that was Mechanical Engineering, specialising in fluid dynamics and heat transfer.",
